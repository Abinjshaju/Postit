# Web App Project: Users Can Post Content

---

## 1. Functional Requirements

### User Registration and Authentication
- Users can sign up with their email or social media accounts.
- Users must authenticate (login) to post content.

### User Profile Management
- Each user has a personal profile.
- Users can edit their profile information (name, bio, profile picture).

### Post Creation
- Users can create posts with text, images, or links.
- Users can categorize posts by tags.

### Post Interaction
- Users can like, comment, or share posts.
- Users can follow/unfollow other users to view their posts in a feed.

### Content Moderation
- Admins can moderate content by deleting or flagging inappropriate posts.
- Users can report inappropriate posts.

### Search and Discovery
- Users can search for posts by keywords or tags.
- A trending section displaying the most popular posts.

### Notifications
- Users receive notifications when someone interacts with their posts or comments.

### Privacy and Security
- Users can make posts private or public.
- Implement data security protocols to protect user information.

## 2. Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Posts should load quickly with minimal delay.

### Scalability
- The system should be scalable to handle growing user activity and storage.

### Usability
- The interface should be intuitive and user-friendly.

### Reliability
- Ensure the app has high availability and minimal downtime.

### Security
- Use encryption for sensitive data.
- Implement role-based access control for admins and users.

## Project Plan

### Phase 1: Planning (1 week)
- Define the scope and finalize requirements.
- Choose the tech stack (e.g., React for frontend, FastAPI for backend, PostgreSQL for database).

### Phase 2: Design (2 weeks)
- Design wireframes for the UI.
- Design the database schema to manage users, posts, and interactions.
- Plan API endpoints for the backend (e.g., post creation, user profile management, etc.).

### Phase 3: Development (4â€“6 weeks)

#### Backend Development
- Set up user registration, authentication, and session management (OAuth or JWT).
- Implement CRUD functionality for posts (create, read, update, delete).
- Implement API endpoints for interactions (likes, comments, follows).

#### Frontend Development
- Implement UI based on wireframes using React.
- Create components for user profile, post feed, and post creation.

#### Database Management
- Set up a PostgreSQL (or other RDBMS) database.
- Define tables for users, posts, comments, likes, and follow relationships.

### Phase 4: Testing (2 weeks)
- Unit testing of backend API.
- User testing for UI/UX feedback.
- Security testing for vulnerabilities.

### Phase 5: Deployment (1 week)
- Set up cloud hosting (e.g., AWS, DigitalOcean).
- Deploy the backend using Docker (if applicable).
- Set up a CI/CD pipeline for seamless updates.

### Phase 6: Post-Launch (Ongoing)
- Monitor app performance.
- Add new features based on user feedback (e.g., advanced search, better notification system).
